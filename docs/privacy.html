        <h2>Overview</h2>
        <p>5-4-3-2-1 Grounding ("the App") is a mindfulness application that guides users through the 5-4-3-2-1 grounding technique. Your privacy is important to us, and this policy explains how the App handles your data.</p>

        <h2>Data Collection and Storage</h2>
        <h3 style="font-size:17px; margin-top:20px; margin-bottom:8px;">Data Stored Locally on Your Device</h3>
        <p>All data created within the App is stored <strong>exclusively on your device</strong>. This includes:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Reflection entries:</strong> Text you enter or dictate describing what you see, touch, hear, smell, and taste during grounding exercises.</li>
            <li><strong>Voice recordings:</strong> Audio recordings of your reflections, saved as audio files on your device.</li>
            <li><strong>Location names:</strong> City or neighborhood names associated with your reflections (e.g., "Downtown, Seattle"), captured only when you grant location permission.</li>
            <li><strong>App preferences:</strong> Your selected color theme and any custom voice prompts you record.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3 style="font-size:17px; margin-top:20px; margin-bottom:8px;">No Data Sent to External Servers</h3>
        <p>The App does <strong>not</strong> collect, transmit, or store any of your personal data on external servers. All information remains on your device.</p>

        <h2>Permissions</h2>
        <p>The App may request the following permissions. Each is optional, and the App functions without them:</p>

        <h3 style="font-size:17px; margin-top:20px; margin-bottom:8px;">Microphone Access</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Purpose:</strong> To record your voice during grounding exercises and to create custom voice prompts.</li>
            <li><strong>Usage:</strong> Audio is recorded locally and stored only on your device. Recordings are never uploaded or shared.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3 style="font-size:17px; margin-top:20px; margin-bottom:8px;">Speech Recognition</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Purpose:</strong> To transcribe your spoken reflections into text in real time.</li>
            <li><strong>Usage:</strong> Apple's on-device speech recognition is used to convert speech to text. Transcription data is processed locally and is not sent to any third-party service.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3 style="font-size:17px; margin-top:20px; margin-bottom:8px;">Location Access (When In Use)</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Purpose:</strong> To tag your reflections with a place name (city or neighborhood) so you can remember where you were.</li>
            <li><strong>Usage:</strong> The App uses Apple's reverse geocoding to convert your coordinates into a readable place name. Only the place name is stored. Location is accessed only when the App is in the foreground.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Third-Party Services</h2>
        <p>The App does <strong>not</strong> use any third-party analytics, advertising, or tracking services. There are no third-party SDKs that collect user data.</p>

        <h2>Data Sharing</h2>
        <p>We do <strong>not</strong> share, sell, or transfer any of your data to third parties. Your reflections, recordings, and location data remain private and on your device.</p>

        <h2>Data Retention and Deletion</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>All data is stored locally on your device.</li>
            <li>You can delete individual reflections within the App at any time.</li>
            <li>Uninstalling the App removes all associated data from your device.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Children's Privacy</h2>
        <p>The App does not knowingly collect personal information from children under 13. The App is suitable for general audiences and does not require account creation.</p>

        <h2>Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>
        <p>We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. Any changes will be reflected in the "Last Updated" date at the top of this page.</p>
