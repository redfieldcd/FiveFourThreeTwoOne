# Privacy Policy for 5-4-3-2-1 Grounding

**Last Updated: February 25, 2025**

## Overview

5-4-3-2-1 Grounding ("the App") is a mindfulness application that guides users through the 5-4-3-2-1 grounding technique. Your privacy is important to us, and this policy explains how the App handles your data.

## Data Collection and Storage

### Data Stored Locally on Your Device

All data created within the App is stored **exclusively on your device**. This includes:

- **Reflection entries**: Text you enter or dictate describing what you see, touch, hear, smell, and taste during grounding exercises.
- **Voice recordings**: Audio recordings of your reflections, saved as audio files on your device.
- **Location names**: City or neighborhood names associated with your reflections (e.g., "Downtown, Seattle"), captured only when you grant location permission.
- **App preferences**: Your selected color theme and any custom voice prompts you record.

### No Data Sent to External Servers

The App does **not** collect, transmit, or store any of your personal data on external servers. All information remains on your device.

## Permissions

The App may request the following permissions. Each is optional, and the App functions without them:

### Microphone Access
- **Purpose**: To record your voice during grounding exercises and to create custom voice prompts.
- **Usage**: Audio is recorded locally and stored only on your device. Recordings are never uploaded or shared.

### Speech Recognition
- **Purpose**: To transcribe your spoken reflections into text in real time.
- **Usage**: Apple's on-device speech recognition is used to convert speech to text. Transcription data is processed locally and is not sent to any third-party service.

### Location Access (When In Use)
- **Purpose**: To tag your reflections with a place name (city or neighborhood) so you can remember where you were.
- **Usage**: The App uses Apple's reverse geocoding to convert your coordinates into a readable place name. Only the place name is stored — exact GPS coordinates are not saved. Location is accessed only when the App is in the foreground.

## Third-Party Services

The App does **not** use any third-party analytics, advertising, or tracking services. There are no third-party SDKs that collect user data.

## Data Sharing

We do **not** share, sell, or transfer any of your data to third parties. Your reflections, recordings, and location data remain private and on your device.

## Data Retention and Deletion

- All data is stored locally on your device.
- You can delete individual reflections within the App at any time.
- Uninstalling the App removes all associated data from your device.

## Children's Privacy

The App does not knowingly collect personal information from children under 13. The App is suitable for general audiences and does not require account creation.

## Changes to This Privacy Policy

We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. Any changes will be reflected in the "Last Updated" date at the top of this page.
